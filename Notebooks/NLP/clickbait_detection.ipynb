        "In this project, we will build and evaluate transformer-based models for detecting clickbait headlines. Clickbait refers to content with misleading or sensationalized headlines designed primarily to attract attention and encourage visitors to click on a link, often at the expense of accuracy or quality. Detecting clickbait automatically is an important NLP task with applications in content moderation and media literacy.\n"
