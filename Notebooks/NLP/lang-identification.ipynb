    "In this project, I built a language identification classifier that distinguishes between six languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Hausa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_language)\n",
    "- [Indonesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language)\n",
    "- [Manobo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manobo_languages)\n",
    "- [Nahuatl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuatl)\n",
    "- [Swahili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language)\n",
    "- [Tagalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagalog_language)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some languages can be distinguished easily, because they use different scripts. These six languages, however, use the same ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script)) script with minimal [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic) so it is difficult to hand-craft classifiers based on the presence or absence of particular characters. Indeed, unless you have linguistic training or familiarity with the languages, it is difficult to tell them apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can they be distinguished? A naïve approach is to use word counts as unigram features. However, the number of possible words in a large corpus of five languages is vast. It is essential to look at something smaller — characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the six languages use roughly the same characters, the relative frequencies of these characters vary greatly. Thus, using characters as features (unigram character models) is appealing (and fairly effective). It is also true that languages vary in their *phonotactics*, the way in which consonants and vowels combine in sequence. Thus, looking at character ngrams (for small values of $n$) is also appealing (and effective). Note, however, that as the value of $n$ increases, this approach runs into the same problem as the word unigram model (sparcity). In this scenario, the model is likely to overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various kinds of classifiers can be used for this application. NB classifiers, for example, are quite effective. However, inference is slow and performance, given the same training set, is likely to be worse than other options. Simple logistic regression cannot be used because this is an n-way (multinomial) classification problem. Multinomial Logistic Regression (Softmax Regression) is a good fit."

    "## How to Use Jupyter Notebooks for Our Assignment\n",
    "Throughout our first assignment, we'll utilize Jupyter Notebooks to walk you through concepts, let you implement them, and also allow you to experiment on your own. By the end of this assignment, you'll not only understand word embeddings more deeply but will also become familiar with a powerful tool used extensively in the data science community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Cells:\n",
    "**Markdown Cells**: These cells (like the one you're reading now) are utilized to write text, frame explanations, embed images, or even formulate equations. They make our notebook more explanatory and structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Cells**: This is where the action happens. In these cells, you'll write and execute Python code. They will play a critical role in our exercises as you experiment with word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Warning*: Refrain from rearranging, adding, or deleting any cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Runtime Volatility\n",
    "As you navigate and execute the cells within this Jupyter notebook, it's crucial to understand that the runtime environment is volatile. In simpler terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   If you restart the notebook or experience a disconnection, all your in-memory data and variables will be lost.\n",
    "*   While the code and markdown cells will remain, the outputs from code cells will need to be regenerated by rerunning them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if you're working on a task over an extended period or with large datasets, remember to save your results and progress frequently to avoid potential data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running this Notebook on Google Colab\n",
    "Google Colab is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. To run this notebook on Colab:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Save a copy of this notebook on your **Google Drive**.\n",
    "2.   Open the notebook in Google Colab.\n",
    "3.   In Google Colab, you can execute each cell using the play button (or use the keyboard shortcuts mentioned above).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip**: Google Colab may automatically disconnect after a certain period of inactivity. Keep this in mind, especially when running longer tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Google Colab provides free access to GPUs and TPUs, which might be useful for later assignments."

The diagonal entries represent correct classifications; anything off of the diagonal represents an incorrect classification.
